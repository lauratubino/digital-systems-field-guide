## Introduction to Pico

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller that's perfect for learning about:
- Direct hardware control
- Real-time operations
- Embedded systems
- Basic computer architecture

:::note[Pico vs Raspberry Pi]
While the Raspberry Pi is a complete computer, the Pico is a microcontroller designed for specific tasks and direct hardware interaction.

## Getting Started with Pico

### Setup
1. Install MicroPython on your Pico
2. Connect to your computer
3. Set up Thonny IDE
4. Test basic functionality

### Basic LED Project
```python
from machine import Pin
import time

led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)    # Onboard LED on GPIO 25

while True:
    led.toggle()
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

## Connecting Pico to Raspberry Pi

### Communication Methods
1. USB Serial
2. I2C
3. SPI
4. UART

Create a weather station:
- Pico collects sensor data
- Sends to Raspberry Pi
- Pi displays on web interface
