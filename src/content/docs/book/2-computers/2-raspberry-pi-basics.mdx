## Introduction to Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a small, affordable computer that helps us understand how computers work. It has all the basic components we discussed but in a more accessible format.

### Components of Raspberry Pi

![Raspberry Pi 4B components](../images-common/raspberry-pi-4b-board-layout-top-view.png)

- Processor (CPU)
- GPIO pins for input/output
- USB ports for peripherals
- HDMI output
- SD card slot for storage
- Network connectivity

:::note[Hardware Setup]
Before starting:
1. Make sure your SD card is properly formatted or have a working operating system.
2. Connect display via HDMI.
3. Connect keyboard and mouse.
4. Power up using appropriate power supply.

## Basic GPIO Projects

### Project 1: LED Control
:::tip[Activity: LED Blinking]

Materials needed:
- LED
- 220Î© resistor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

Steps:
1. Connect LED to GPIO pin 18
2. Add resistor in series
3. Connect ground
4. Run the following Python code:
```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)

while True:
    GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)
    time.sleep(1)
    GPIO.output(18, GPIO.LOW)
    time.sleep(1)
```

### Project 2: Input and Output
:::tip[Activity]
**Button-Controlled LED**
Build upon the previous project by:
1. Adding a push button
2. Using button press to control LED
3. Implementing different lighting patterns

## Understanding Data Flow

### Analog to Digital Conversion
```python
# Example using an analog sensor
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Setup code here
```

:::note[Important Concept]
Computers work with digital data, but many real-world signals are analog. The conversion process is crucial for interfacing with the physical world.
