## Introduction to Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a remarkable piece of technology that revolutionized the world of computing education and DIY electronics. This credit card-sized computer packs all the essential components of a full-sized computer onto a single circuit board, making it a perfect learning tool and platform for creative projects.

## What Makes It Special?

Unlike traditional computers that spread their components across multiple boards and parts, the Raspberry Pi is what's known as a Single Board Computer (SBC). Imagine having your processor, memory, graphics, and input/output connections all integrated onto one compact board - that's what makes the Pi special. This all-in-one design not only keeps costs down (typically ranging from $35-75) but also makes it easier to understand how different computer components work together.

## Versatility and Applications

What truly sets the Raspberry Pi apart is its versatility. You can use it as:

* **Desktop Computer**: Perfect for basic computing tasks like web browsing, document editing, and email management. Its compact size makes it ideal for creating space-efficient workstations.

* **Learning Platform**: An excellent tool for learning programming languages, understanding electronics, and exploring computer science concepts. The hands-on nature of the Pi makes abstract computing concepts tangible.

* **Project Hub**: Serves as the brain for countless DIY projects, from home automation systems to weather stations. Its GPIO pins allow direct interaction with sensors, motors, and other electronic components.

* **Media Center**: Can transform any TV into a smart entertainment system, capable of streaming media, running retro games, and managing digital content libraries.

### Components of Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B board consists of all the components needed for a fully functioning computer:

1. **Broadcom BCM2711 SoC (System on Chip)**
   - The brain of the Raspberry Pi
   - Contains the CPU, GPU, and other essential processing components
   - Quad-core processor designed specifically for the Pi 4

2. **Micron LPDDR4 SDRAM**
   - The main memory (RAM) of the system
   - LPDDR4 indicates it's low-power DDR4 memory
   - Used for running programs and temporary data storage

3. **GPIO 40-Pin Header**
   - General Purpose Input/Output pins
   - Allows connection to various electronic components, sensors, and displays
   - Essential for hardware projects and prototyping

4. **USB Ports**
   - 2x USB 3.0 ports (Blue)
   - 2x USB 2.0 ports
   - VL805 USB Controller manages these connections
   - Supports keyboards, mice, external drives, etc.

5. **Network Connectivity**
   - RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet port
   - BCM54213PE Ethernet Controller
   - Dual Band WiFi (2.4GHz & 5GHz)
   - Bluetooth 5.0
   - PoE (Power over Ethernet) Hat Header for network power

6. **Display Connections**
   - 2x Micro HDMI ports for dual display output
   - DSI Display Port for official Raspberry Pi touchscreen
   - CSI Camera Port for Raspberry Pi camera modules
   - 3.5mm 4-Pole Composite Audio-Video Output

You can read the full specifications of the RPi 4B at this [datacapturecontrol blog post](https://datacapturecontrol.com/articles/io-devices/single-board-computers/raspberry-pi-4b) and [RPi official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/).

:::note[Hardware Setup]
Before starting:
1. Make sure your SD card is properly formatted or have a working operating system.
2. Connect display via HDMI.
3. Connect keyboard and mouse.
4. Power up using appropriate power supply.

## Basic GPIO Projects

### Project 1: LED Control
:::tip[Activity: LED Blinking]

We will be controlling an LED using the GPIO pins on the RPi.

Materials needed:
- LED
- 220Î© resistor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

Steps: Follow the steps given in the [blog post here](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/27968772-turning-on-an-led-with-your-raspberry-pis-gpio-pins)

Run the following Python code:
```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)

while True:
    GPIO.output(18, GPIO.HIGH)
    time.sleep(1)
    GPIO.output(18, GPIO.LOW)
    time.sleep(1)
```

The circuit should look like this:
