## Understanding the CPU

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the "brain" of the computer, following a cycle of:
1. Fetch instructions
2. Decode instructions
3. Execute instructions
4. Store results

### Clock Cycles
:::note[Clock Basics]
The computer's clock is like a heartbeat that keeps all operations synchronized. Each tick of the clock allows the CPU to perform an operation.

## Hands-on CPU Simulation

### Activity 1: Human CPU
:::tip[Activity]
**Simulate CPU Operations**
1. One student acts as CPU
2. Others provide instructions
3. Follow fetch-decode-execute cycle
4. Keep track of clock cycles
:::

### Activity 2: Programming the Clock
```python
import time

def clock_simulation():
    cycle = 0
    while True:
        print(f"Clock Cycle: {cycle}")
        # Perform operation
        cycle += 1
        time.sleep(1)
```

## Memory and Storage

### Types of Memory
1. RAM (Random Access Memory)
   - Temporary storage
   - Fast access
   - Loses data when powered off

2. ROM (Read Only Memory)
   - Permanent storage
   - Slower access
   - Retains data without power

:::tip[Memory Experiment]
Create a program that demonstrates:
1. Writing to different types of storage
2. Measuring access speeds
3. Understanding data persistence
:::

## Advanced Projects

### Project 1: Simple Computer
Build a basic computer using:
- Raspberry Pi
- Multiple LEDs
- Buttons
- Display

### Project 2: Data Processing Unit
Create a system that:
1. Takes input from sensors
2. Processes data
3. Stores results
4. Displays output

:::note[Extension Ideas]
- Add more complex instructions
- Implement error checking
- Add parallel processing concepts
