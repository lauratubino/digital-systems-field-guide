This module explores the fundamental concepts of computer architecture, from basic components to practical applications.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Explain the definition and purpose of a computer.
- Identify and describe the function of basic components of a computer (hardware and software) using physical examples.
- Understand how the CPU interacts with memory and peripheral devices.
- Use a Raspberry Pi to demonstrate how computers process input, output, storage, and processing.
- Demonstrate how high-level programming translates to low-level hardware control.
