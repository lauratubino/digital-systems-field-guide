Now that we have explored transistors, logic gates, chips, and memory, it is time to step back and ask, how do all these individual components come together to create a working computer?

We started our digital systems discussions with transistors that control the flow of electricity in digital circuits. We explored how transistors are combined to form logic gates, which perform basic decision-making tasks. These gates then build circuits, like half-adders and adders, which become the foundation for computer chips.

We then looked at a way to store and process information using the fundamental building blocks we learned. We learned about how computer memory is formed from basic concepts of flip-flop circuits to RAM to hold the instructions and data needed for computation.

:::note[Think about It: Thinking beyond what we have learnt]

- How does a computer decide which instruction to execute?
- Where does software fit into all of this?
- How do different components—Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices—communicate seamlessly?
  
:::

Next, we are going to find answers to above question by exploring the world of computer architecture, where we examine how a computer is structured, how it processes information, and how all the components we have learned about so far work together to create the powerful machines we use every day.

## What is a Computer?

A computer is a machine that processes information through four main operations:
1. Receiving input
2. Processing data
3. Storing information
4. Providing output

:::note[Think about It]
Computers come in different forms that are not just laptops and desktops. Many everyday devices are actually computers including smart home devices and kitchen appliances.

 Watch the following video to understand how all these operations work together.

:::tip[Activity: Computer Scavenger Hunt]

- Walk around the room/ your home and list every device that might be a computer
- For each device, identify:
  -  Input methods
  -  Output methods
  -  What kind of processing it does
  -  Where it stores information
