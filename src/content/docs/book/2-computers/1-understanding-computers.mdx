## What is a Computer?

A computer is a machine that processes information through four main operations:
1. Receiving input
2. Processing data
3. Storing information
4. Providing output

:::note[Think About It]
Computers aren't just laptops and desktops. Many everyday devices are actually computers in disguise! Watch [How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKGZlaPlVLY&ab_channel=Code.org) to understand how all these operations work together.

## Computers in Daily Life

### Common Examples
- Smartphones
- Gaming consoles
- Smart home devices
- Digital watches
- Car computers
- Kitchen appliances

### Activity: Computer Hunt
:::tip[Activity: **Computer Scavenger Hunt**]
1. Walk around your home
2. List every device that might be a computer
3. For each device, identify:
   - Input methods
   - Output methods
   - What kind of processing it does
   - Where it stores information
