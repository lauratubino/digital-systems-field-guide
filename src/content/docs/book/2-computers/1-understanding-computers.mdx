title: Understanding Computer Fundamentals
---
Now that we've explored transistors, logic gates, chips, and memory, it's time to step back and ask: How do all these individual components come together to create a working computer?

We started with transistors, tiny switches that control the flow of electricity. We saw how they combine to form logic gates, which perform basic decision-making tasks. These gates then build circuits, like adders and multiplexers, which become the foundation for computer chips.

But a computer isnâ€™t just a collection of chips. It needs a way to store and process information. Thatâ€™s where memory comes inâ€”registers and RAM hold the instructions and data needed for computation.

At this point, you might be wondering:
ðŸ’¡ How does a computer decide which instruction to execute next?
ðŸ’¡ Where does software fit into all of this?
ðŸ’¡ How do different componentsâ€”CPU, memory, and input/output devicesâ€”communicate seamlessly?

These questions take us into the world of computer architecture, where we examine how a computer is structured, how it processes information, and how all the components we've learned about so far work together to create the powerful machines we use every day.

In the next section, we will break down the key parts of computer architecture, explore how a processor executes instructions, and even write Python code on a Raspberry Pi to interact with hardwareâ€”bridging the gap between electronics and real-world computing! 

## What is a Computer?

A computer is a machine that processes information through four main operations:
1. Receiving input
2. Processing data
3. Storing information
4. Providing output

Computers aren't just laptops and desktops. Many everyday devices are actually computers in disguise! Watch [How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKGZlaPlVLY&ab_channel=Code.org) to understand how all these operations work together.
