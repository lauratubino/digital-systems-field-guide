title: Understanding Electronics
---

We are going to get started understanding digital systems, building up from some basic understanding of electronics.

The [Build Electronic Circuits](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com) website has some great articles to help you get started with this.

- Start with the [Understanding Basic Electronics](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/basic-electronics/) page. This will give you a quick overview of electronic systems.
- Next read the page on [Basic Electronic Components Used in Circuits](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/basic-electronic-components/) followed by the [Identify Electronic Components (Quick Reference)](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/identify-electronic-components/). You want to be able to identify:
  - Batteries and 9V Battery Clip
  - Breadboard
  - Breadboard wires
  - Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
  - Resistors
  - Push buttons, and
  - Transistor

## First Circuit

With these basics in hand, you should now be ready to build your first electronic circuit - connecting a light.

For this you will need:

- Breadboard
- Breadboard wires
- Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
- Resistor
- Battery

Connect the battery to the resistor, then to the LED, and back to the battery. The [Simple LED Circuit](https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/simplle-led-circuit-diagram) instructions on Circuit Digest can guide you through this.

:::tip[Connect with the electronics basics]

Think back to the material you read on circuit basics, and think about the current flowing through this and how this interacts with the LED.

## Second Circuit

To wrap up this module, let's add in a push button to control when the light is active. The [https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/simplle-led-circuit-diagram](https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/push-button-led-circuit) will guide you through these steps.
