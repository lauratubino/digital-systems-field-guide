## Basic Transistor Structure

A transistor has three essential parts:

1. Base: Controls the switch

   - Acts as the control terminal
   - Regulates current flow
   - Creates amplification effect

2. Collector:

   - Receives incoming current
   - Collects majority carriers
   - Connects to power supply in amplifier circuits

3. Emitter:
   - Outputs current flow
   - Releases majority carriers
   - Usually connected to ground

:::tip[Important Concept]
Think of a transistor as a water valve where a small amount of water (base current) controls a much larger flow (collector-emitter current).

## Building Your First Transistor Circuit

1. Connect the LED and resistor to the collector and power supply
2. Use a 1kÎ© resistor to connect the base to a manual switch
3. Observe how a small base current controls the LED

:::note
Even when "off", transistors have a tiny leakage current (Iceo or Icbo), typically in the nanoamp range. While usually negligible, this becomes important in:

- Low power designs
- High precision measurements
- Battery-operated devices
- High temperature applications
