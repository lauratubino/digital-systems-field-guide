In the previous Chapter, we have seen that circuits relied on manual switches to control the flow of electricity. When you turned on a LED, you had to physically press a switch to complete the circuit. However, modern digital systems, from computers to smartphones, require switching at speeds far beyond human capability. 

This is where transistors come in. A transistor acts as an electronic switch, allowing current to flow when a small voltage is applied to its control terminal. By replacing manual switches with transistors, we can automate control the current, enabling the creation of logic circuits, processors, and entire digital systems. In addition to its switching function, transistors can also amplify the signals. Understanding transistors is the key to unlocking how computers think, process information, and make decisions without human intervention.

## Basic Transistor Structure

Watch the following video to learn about how transistors work, the basic functions, different types of transistors.

As explained in the above video transistor has three essential parts which we need to know to build your own circuits with transistors. The three parts of the transistor are: 

1. Base: Controls the switch

   - Acts as the control terminal
   - Regulates current flow
   - Creates amplification effect

2. Collector:

   - Receives incoming current
   - Collects majority carriers
   - Connects to power supply in amplifier circuits

3. Emitter:
   - Outputs current flow
   - Releases majority carriers
   - Usually connected to ground
  


:::Note
Think of a transistor as a water valve where a small amount of water (base current) controls a much larger flow (collector-emitter current).

1. Connect the LED and resistor to the collector and power supply
2. Use a 1kÎ© resistor to connect the base to a manual switch
3. Observe how a small base current controls the LED

:::note
Even when "off", transistors have a tiny leakage current, typically in the nanoampere (nA) range. While usually negligible, this becomes important in:

- Low power designs
- High precision measurements
- Battery-operated devices
- High temperature applications
