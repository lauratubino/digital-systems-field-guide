title: Overview
---

This module explores the transition from manual switches to automated electronic controls, demonstrating how transistors and logic gates form the building blocks of modern digital devices.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module you should understand:

- How transistors automate switching
- The basics of logic gates
- understand truth tables and logic operations
- demonstrate how complex operations are built from simple gates
- describe how integrated circuits combine multiple gates into chips

## Required Materials

For the basic transistor activities:

- Breadboard
- NPN transistors
- Resistors (1kΩ for base, 220Ω for LEDs)
- LEDs
- Push-button switches
- Power supply / battery
- Jumper wires

:::note
Color-code your wires for easier circuit building:

- Red for power (VCC)
- Black for ground
- Different colors for inputs/outputs
