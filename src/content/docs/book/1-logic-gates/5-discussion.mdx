Before the complex circuits are build and experiment, these circuits are designed in a simulation environment. One of the simple platforms that we can use to simulate the circuits is Tinkercad. You can access Tinkercad via (https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits). 

Check whether you can build a simple circuit in Tinkercad. 

:::note[Advanced Projects]
For additional challenge:

- Build a full adder
- Create a simple calculator
- Build a simple latch circuit (memory circuit) using transistors

:::note
Remember to always use current-limiting resistors with LEDs and base resistors for transistor protection.
