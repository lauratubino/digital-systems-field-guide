## NOT Gate (Inverter)

Required components:

- 1 NPN transistor
- 1 LED
- Resistors (1kΩ, 220Ω)
- Push-button switch

Build steps:

1. Connect input to the base via 1kΩ resistor
2. Connect LED to collector with 220Ω resistor
3. Test operation: Input HIGH → LED OFF

:::tip[Think About It]
When the input is HIGH (button pressed), why does the LED turn OFF? How does this relate to the NOT gate's truth table?

## OR Gate

Required components:

- 2 NPN transistors
- 1 LED
- Resistors (2x 1kΩ, 220Ω)
- 2 Push-button switches

Build steps:

1. Connect transistors in parallel
2. Connect each base to a separate switch
3. Verify: LED ON if either/both buttons pressed

## AND Gate

Required components:

- 2 NPN transistors
- 1 LED
- Resistors (2x 1kΩ, 220Ω)
- 2 Push-button switches

Build steps:

1. Connect transistors in series
2. Connect each base to a separate switch
3. Verify: LED ON only when both switches pressed
