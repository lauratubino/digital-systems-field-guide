##  Storing the Digital World

So far, we have seen how logic gates can make simple decisions and how chips combine millions of these gates to process information. However, processing alone is not enough to perform the functions of modern digital systems. Computers also need a way to store and recall information. Yes, we use memory. 

 Computers face the same challenges as we do when it comes to performing tasks. Like we take notes and write down the steps, computer need to store the steps and data. Computers need memory circuits to store data temporarily while working on a task (such as in Random Access Memory, RAM) and to keep important information even when powered off (such as in hard drives or portable storage).

Computer memory are circuits built from logic gates which we have studied in the previous sections. 

A flip-flop circuit, made of NAND or NOR gates, is the fundamental building block of memory. This simple circuit can store a single bit—either a 0 or a 1 until it is changed by a new input. By combining millions of these flip-flops, we can create RAM, registers, and cache memory, which allow computers to quickly store and retrieve data.

Watch the following video to understand how a flip-flop circuit works. 

Beyond RAM, computers also use long-term storage like solid-state drives SSDs and hard drives, which store data using more advanced memory technologies, such as flash memory and magnetic storage.


Next, we’ll explore how different types of memory work, why speed and capacity matter, and how storage devices shape computing performance.
