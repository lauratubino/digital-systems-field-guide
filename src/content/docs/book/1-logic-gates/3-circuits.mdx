## Building a Half-Adder

A half-adder adds two binary bits (A and B) to produce a Sum and Carry.

Truth Table:

```
A  B  Sum  Carry
0  0   0     0
0  1   1     0
1  0   1     0
1  1   0     1
```

:::note
The half-adder combines:

- XOR gate for Sum output
- AND gate for Carry output
  :::

### Building Steps

1. Create XOR gate using combination of basic gates
2. Add AND gate for Carry
3. Connect inputs A and B via pushbuttons
4. Use LEDs to display Sum and Carry
5. Test all input combinations
