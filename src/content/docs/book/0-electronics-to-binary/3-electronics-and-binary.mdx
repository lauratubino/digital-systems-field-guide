title: Electronics and Binary
---

The ingenious idea of computing is the use of electronic circuits to represent information. By coming up with a way of representing information, we have been able to create machines that operate on this information.

So, to get to digital systems, we need a way of representing information in data that electronics can understand or represent.

How does this happen?

## Thinking about Current

The LED circuit with the button is a great starting point when thinking about this. We want a way to represent information, and the button circuit shows that you can have electronic components that behave differently in the presence or absence of current.

Think of the LED. When there is current, the LED is on. When there is no current, the LED if off.

Can this be used somehow to create information?

## Understanding Binary Systems

The fundamental concept of communication between computers using binary is simple:

Electric current can represent two states:

- "ON" (1)
- "OFF" (0)

:::note
In a 5V system such as RPi or modern computers:

- 3.5V-5V = logical "1"
- 0V-1.5V = logical "0"
- 1.5V-3.5V = undefined (avoided in normal operation)
  :::

This becomes interestingly useful when you think of the **binary number system**. This system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. These can be combined to make any number. So by *thinking* of this presence of current as 1 and absence of current as 0, then we have the basis of creating a system that can represent information.

**This is the foundation of all digital systems!**

:::note
Read about the [Binary Number System](https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html) on Maths is Fun to familiarise yourself with this way of expressing values.
:::

The next step is to think about how to start using these ideas to work with different things we want to represent. For this we will look at common ways of representing binary in a shorter format, and then using binary to represent text. Similar ideas can then be applied to representing other things like colours, images, sounds, and so on.

## A 5-bit Visualization

:::tip[Activity: A 5-bit visualizer]

In computing a single binary digit is called a bit. So, let's create a simple 5-bit visualization using the electronics we reviewed in the last page. Connect up to 5 LEDs to switches so that you can turn each LED on or off individually. You can then use this to visualise binary values by thinking of each LED as a binary digit. When the LED is on, then the digit is 1, when it is off, then the digit is a 0.

### Required Materials

For the activity in this module, you will need:

- Breadboard 
- Jumper wires
- 5 LEDs (any colour)
- 5 Resistors (220 ohms for each LED)
- 9V battery with battery clip (preferred)/ 5V power supply
- 5 Push-button switches

### Resources
- [ASCII Table](https://www.ascii-code.com/)
- [ASCII To BINARY converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-binary.html)


### Steps
1. Connect 5 LEDs in parallel rows on the breadboard, each with a resistor in series
2. Use jumper wires to connect each LED to the power supply via separate inputs (push buttons)
3. Leave the negative ends of the LEDs connected to the ground
4. Manually turn each LED ON/OFF to verify the connections

You can use the 9V battery provided to setup the power. Your circuit should look like this:

### Understanding Bit Positions

Each LED represents a specific bit position:

- LED1 (rightmost) = 2^0 = 1
- LED2 = 2^1 = 2
- LED3 = 2^2 = 4
- LED4 = 2^3 = 8
- LED5 = 2^4 = 16

### Binary Number Examples

Lighting LEDs in specific patterns represents different binary numbers:

- 00001 = 1
- 00011 = 3
- 10101 = 21

**Activity:** Take turn in groups to send and decode values. Use some values from the [Binary Number System](https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html) page. 

:::note
Remember to always verify your connections before applying power to the circuit. Double-check your resistor values to protect your LEDs.

In this activity you may encounter an interesting issue of which light is the first digit. This is also an issue in computing known as [endianness](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/big-endian-and-little-endian#:~:text=The%20term%20endianness%20describes%20the,to%20the%20value%20stored%20first.). So there is no right or wrong way to read these values, the main thing is that you read it in an agreed order.

Now that we have a way of representing numbers using binary digits, let's move on to consider how to use this to represent things.
