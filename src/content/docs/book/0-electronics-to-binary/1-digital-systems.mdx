title: Digital Systems

A digital system is a system that processes, stores, and transmits information which transforms data into a digital solution. Digital systems are everywhere in our daily lives and can be understood through their three main functions:

### 1. Getting Information In (Receiving Input Data)

Digital systems need a way to receive data through:

#### Direct Interaction

- Typing on a keyboard
- Speaking into a microphone
- Moving and clicking a mouse

#### Sensors

- Temperature sensors
- Motion detectors
- Light sensors
- GPS receivers

:::tip[Exercise]
Look around your room right now. How many different ways can you find that digital devices are receiving input? Think about your phone, laptop, smart watch or smart home devices.

### 2. Working with the Information (Processing or storing the data)

The system:

- Processes the incoming data
- Performs calculations and operations
- Stores information for later use
- Compares, sorts, or transforms data

:::note[Did you Know?]
Modern smartphones have more processing power than the computers used in the first moon landing! This shows how far digital systems have evolved.

### 3. Sending Information Out (Providing output)

The processed information is presented through:

- Visual: Showing text or images on screens
- Audio: Playing sounds through speakers
- Physical: Printing documents
- Movement: Controlling motors or actuators

:::note[Let's Think]
Every output you see from a digital device had to be processed from some form of input. Can you trace the path of information in your favorite device?

### Common Digital Systems

These three parts work together in devices we use daily:

- Smartphones
- Smart TVs
- Gaming consoles
- Digital cameras
- Smart home devices
- Fitness trackers

### Activities and Exploration

:::tip[Activity: Digital System Hunt]
Identify digital systems in your surroundings and analyze their components.

**Task:**

1. List 3 digital systems you can find.
2. For each system, identify:
   - Its main purpose
   - Input methods
   - Output methods
   - Processing capabilities
3. Identify the following for each system:
   - Where and why is it used?
   - What problems does it solve?
   - How does it process input?
   - What are its limitations?
   - How could it be improved?
4. For each system, discuss and identify:
   - Can we live without it?
   - How would life be different without it?
   - How does each component enhance usability?

:::tip[Activity: Digital system usability]
Think about and provide your observation on:

- Systems that have been replaced by newer versions. Look for examples in your home or school where 2 older digital systems have been replaced. What improvements did the new systems bring?
- Why upgrades happen?
- What determines if a system becomes outdated?
- What makes some systems more lasting than others?
- Can we recycle digital systems?
