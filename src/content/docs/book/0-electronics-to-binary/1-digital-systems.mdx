A digital system processes, stores, and transmits information transforming data into a digital solution. Digital systems are everywhere in our daily lives and can be understood through their three main functions:

### 1. Getting Information In (Receiving Input Data)

Digital systems receive data through various input methods, including:

#### Direct Interaction

- Typing on a keyboard
- Speaking into a microphone
- Moving and clicking a mouse

#### Sensors

- Temperature sensors
- Motion detectors
- Light sensors
- GPS receivers

:::tip[Exercise]
Look around your room. How many ways can you find that digital devices receive input? Think about your phone, laptop, smart watch or smart home devices.

### 2. Working with the Information (Processing or storing the data)

A digital system works with that information:

- Processes the incoming data
- Performs calculations and operations
- Stores information for later use
- Compares, sorts, or transforms data

:::note[Did you Know?]
Modern smartphones have more processing power than the computers used for the first moon landing! This shows how far digital systems have evolved.

### 3. Sending Information Out (Providing output)

A digital system can present processed information in different ways, including:

- Visual: Showing text or images on screens
- Audio: Playing sounds through speakers
- Physical: Printing documents
- Movement: Controlling motors or actuators

:::note[Let's Think]
Every output you see from a digital device had to be processed from some form of input. Can you trace the path of information in your favourite device?

### Common Digital Systems

These three functions work together in the digital devices we use every day, such as:

- Smartphones
- Smart TVs
- Gaming consoles
- Digital cameras
- Smart home devices
- Fitness trackers

### Activities and Exploration

:::tip[Activity: Digital System Hunt]
Identify and analyze digital systems in your surroundings.

**Task:**

1. List 3 digital systems you can find in your environment.
2. For each system, identify:
   - Main purpose
   - Input methods
   - Output methods
   - Processing capabilities
3. Analyze each system by considering:
   - Where and why is it used
   - The problems it solves
   - How it processes input
   - Its limitations
   - Potential improvements
4. For each system, discuss and reflect on:
   - Can we live without it?
   - How would life be different without it?
   - How does each component enhance usability?

:::tip[Activity: Digital system usability]
Consider the following questions nd provide your insights:

- Replaced Systems: Identify two older digital systems in your home or school that hve been replaced by newer versions. What improvements did the new systems bring? 
- Why upgrades happen: What drives the need for system upgrades?
- Obsolescence: What factors determine if a system becomes outdated?
- Longevity: Why do some digital systems last longer than others?
- Recycling: Can we recycle digital systems? If so, how?
