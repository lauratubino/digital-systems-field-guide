title: Digital Systems

Digital systems are everywhere in our daily lives and can be understood through their three main functions:

### 1. Getting Information In (Receiving Input Data)

Digital systems need a way to receive data through:

#### Direct Interaction
- Typing on a keyboard
- Speaking into a microphone
- Moving and clicking a mouse

#### Sensors
- Temperature sensors
- Motion detectors
- Light sensors
- GPS receivers

:::tip[Input Examples]
Look around your room right now. How many different ways can you find that digital devices are receiving input? Think about your phone, laptop, or smart home devices.

### 2. Working with the Information (Processing or storing the data)

The system:
- Processes the incoming data
- Performs calculations and operations
- Stores information for later use
- Compares, sorts, or transforms data

:::note[Processing Power]
Modern smartphones have more processing power than the computers used in the first moon landing! This shows how far digital systems have evolved.

### 3. Sending Information Out (Providing output)

The processed information is presented through:

- Visual: Showing text or images on screens
- Audio: Playing sounds through speakers
- Physical: Printing documents
- Movement: Controlling motors or actuators

:::note[Let's Think]
Every output you see from a digital device had to be processed from some form of input. Can you trace the path of information in your favorite device?

### Common Digital Systems

These three parts work together in devices we use daily:
- Smartphones
- Smart TVs
- Gaming consoles
- Digital cameras
- Smart home devices
- Fitness trackers

### Activities and Exploration

:::tip[Activity: Digital System Hunt]
**Task:** Identify digital systems in your surroundings and analyze their components.

Steps:
1. List all digital systems you can find
2. For each system, identify:
   - Its main purpose
   - Input methods
   - Output methods
   - Processing capabilities
3. Identify the following for each system:
    - Where and why is it used?
    - What problems does it solve?
    - How does it process input?
    - What are its limitations?
    - How could it be improved?
:::

### Peer Discussion

#### System Analysis
- Can we live without specific digital systems?
- How would life be different without them?
- How does each component enhance usability?

#### Future Considerations
- What alternative output methods could be developed?
- What's the difference between hardware and software?
- What makes a system "digital"?

:::note[Technology Evolution]
Think about:
- Systems that have been replaced by newer versions. Look for examples in your home or school where older digital systems have been replaced. What improvements did the new systems bring?
- Why upgrades happen
- The role of recycling in digital systems
:::

### Extended Questions

:::tip[Deep Dive Questions]
Consider these points for deeper understanding:
1. What determines if a system becomes outdated?
2. How can components be recycled?
3. Why is recycling important in digital systems?
4. What makes some systems more lasting than others?
