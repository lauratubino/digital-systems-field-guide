## Assessment Questions

### Technical Understanding

1. Digital Voltage Ranges:
   - Why do systems use voltage ranges instead of simple on/off?
   - What happens in the undefined voltage range (1.5V-3.5V)?
   - How do systems prevent undefined states?

2. Number System Conversion:
   - Convert binary 1011 to decimal, showing your work
   - Explain why binary suits digital electronics
   - Demonstrate hexadecimal conversion

:::note
Remember to consider practical applications when answering these questions. Think about how these concepts apply to real-world digital systems.

### ASCII and Encoding

3. Character Processing:
   - What is the complete process when typing 'B'?
   - Why is ASCII encoding necessary?
   - How does standardization help communication?

4. System Comparison:
   - Compare current-based vs voltage-based systems
   - Explain speed and reliability differences
   - Discuss advantages of voltage-level detection
