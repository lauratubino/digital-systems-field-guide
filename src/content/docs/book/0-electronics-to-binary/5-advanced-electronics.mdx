## Digital System Fundamentals

### Voltage-Based Digital Systems

In modern digital electronics, systems use voltage levels rather than simple current presence:

- High voltage range (3.3V or 5V) = logical "1"
- Low voltage range (near 0V) = logical "0"
- Intermediate range = undefined state

This approach provides several advantages:
- Greater reliability with voltage variation tolerance
- Better noise immunity
- Higher operating speeds
- Improved error detection

## Number Systems in Digital Electronics

### Binary (Base-2)

The fundamental number system in digital electronics:

- Uses only 0 and 1
- Position values are powers of 2 (2⁰, 2¹, 2², 2³, etc.)

:::tip[Example Calculation]
Converting binary 1101 to decimal:
- 1×2³ + 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰
- 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13 decimal
:::

### Hexadecimal (Base-16)

A more compact representation of binary data:

- Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F
- Each hex digit represents 4 binary digits
- Common in programming and debugging

:::note
Example conversion:
Hex 1F = 1×16¹ + 15×16⁰ = 31 decimal = 0001 1111 binary

## Data Representation

### ASCII Encoding

The standard system for representing text in digital form:

- Basic ASCII: 7 bits (128 characters)
- Extended ASCII: 8 bits (256 characters)

Common ASCII values:
```
'A' = 65 (decimal) = 41 (hex) = 01000001 (binary)
'a' = 97 (decimal) = 61 (hex) = 01100001 (binary)
'1' = 49 (decimal) = 31 (hex) = 00110001 (binary)
```

:::tip[Digital Communication Process]
When you type 'H' on your keyboard:
1. Keyboard registers 'H'
2. Converts to ASCII (72 decimal)
3. Transmits as binary (01001000)
4. Often displayed as hex (48) for readability
5. Receiving device converts back to 'H'
