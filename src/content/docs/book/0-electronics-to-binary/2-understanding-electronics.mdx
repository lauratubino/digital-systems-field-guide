Now that you are able to identify digital systems and their uses, we are going to get started understanding how these digital systems are made up.

This about a robot as a digital system. Robots do not understand words like we do, they only understand 1s and 0s (on and off, like a light switch). Everything in a computer, phone, or even a game console is made up of tiny parts called electronics circuits that use these 1s and 0s to do math, store information, and make things happen.

Think of electronics as the building blocks that make up a digital system simialr to lego bricks are used to build a lego car. Electronics include tiny components like transistors, resistors, and capacitors that control electricity. When these components are combined, they create circuits that can process signals (on/off, 1s and 0s). A digital system is made by combining many electronic circuits to perform a task.

First, we are goign to look at the basics of elctronics. 

The [Build Electronic Circuits](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com) website has some great articles to help you get started with this.

- Start with the [Understanding Basic Electronics](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/basic-electronics/) page. This will give you a quick overview of electronic systems.
- Next read the page on [Basic Electronic Components Used in Circuits](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/basic-electronic-components/) followed by the [Identify Electronic Components (Quick Reference)](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/identify-electronic-components/). You want to be able to identify:
  - 9V Batteries and Alligator Clips
  - Breadboard
  - Breadboard wires
  - Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
  - Resistors
  - Push buttons, and
  - Transistor
- Ohm's law define the relationship between current, voltage and resistance. If you have not gone through the Ohm's law in [Understanding Basic Electronics](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/basic-electronics/) page, then watch the following video to understand the basics of Ohm's law.

:::note
The provided electronics kit has 220 ohm resistors and NPN transistors. 220 ohm resistors are widely used when working with household batteries and LED projects. Can you identify why?

## Simple Circuit

:::tip[Activity: Your first circuit]

With these basics in hand, you should now be ready to build your first electronic circuit - connecting a light.

For this you will need:

- Battery
- Breadboard
- Jumper cables
- Alligator Clips
- Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
- Resistor

Connect the battery to the resistor, then to the LED, and back to the battery. The [Simple LED Circuit](https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/simplle-led-circuit-diagram) instructions on Circuit Digest can guide you through this. The end circuit should look similar to this:

## Controlled Circuit

:::tip[Activity]

To wrap up this module, let's add in a push button or switch to control when the light is active. The [Push Button LED Circuit](https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/push-button-led-circuit) will guide you through these steps. You can either use the push button or the switch provided.
