## Number Systems in Digital Electronics

### Binary (Base-2)

The fundamental number system in digital electronics:

- Uses only 0 and 1
- Position values are powers of 2 (2⁰, 2¹, 2², 2³, etc.)

:::note[Example Calculation]
Converting binary 1101 to decimal:
- 1×2³ + 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰
- 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13 decimal
:::

### Hexadecimal (Base-16)

A more compact representation of binary data:

- Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F
- Each hex digit represents 4 binary digits
- Common in programming and debugging

:::note
Example conversion:
Hex 1F = 1×16¹ + 15×16⁰ = 31 decimal = 0001 1111 binary

## Data Representation

### ASCII Encoding

The standard system for representing text in digital form:

- Basic ASCII: 7 bits (128 characters)
- Extended ASCII: 8 bits (256 characters)

Common ASCII values:
```
'A' = 65 (decimal) = 41 (hex) = 01000001 (binary)
'a' = 97 (decimal) = 61 (hex) = 01100001 (binary)
'1' = 49 (decimal) = 31 (hex) = 00110001 (binary)
```

:::note[Digital Communication Process]
When you type 'H' on your keyboard:
1. The keyboard registers the key press as 'H'
2. The keyboard converts the character to ASCII code (72 in decimal)
3. The system transmits it as binary (01001000)
4. The binary data is often displayed in hexadecimal (48) for readability
5. The receiving device converts the binary back to 'H'
